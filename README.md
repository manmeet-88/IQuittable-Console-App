# IQuittable Console Application

## Description
This is a C# console application that demonstrates the use of interfaces and polymorphism.
The program defines an interface called `IQuittable` with a `Quit()` method, which is implemented
by an `Employee` class. The application creates an object using the interface type and calls
the implemented method to show polymorphic behavior.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Interfaces in C#
- Interface implementation
- Polymorphism
- Classes and properties
- Console application structure
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles

## How to Run the Application
1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution.
3. Run the program.
4. The console will display a message indicating that the employee has quit.

## Technologies Used
- C#
